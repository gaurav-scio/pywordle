# PyWordle

A simple Python implementation of Wordle from Josh Wardle. I thought it was brilliant but wanted to play it more often than once a day, so I sketched this together fast. PRs and feedback welcome.

You will need the list of frequent English words from [https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english). Clone this repo, then clone that repo within this one.

To play the standard 5-letter word game:
`python wordle.py`

You can modify the code to use different length words as well.
